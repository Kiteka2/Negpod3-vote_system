INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the Nzavote voting system application! This menu-driven program is a Python program designed to facilitate the voting process for upcoming elections. It allows citizens of a country to practice and improve their voting rights by providing a user-friendly interface for voters to cast their votes securely and safely. As a negpod, we were inspired by conflicts of past elections including: wars and clashes between supporters of different parties, killings, riggings, and other forms of electoral fraud to develop a program that is secure, safe, and trusted. 



FEATURES:
1. Menu-Driven Interface: a simple and intuitive menu for easy navigation.
2. Secure Voting: Ensures the intergrity and confidentiality of the voting process.
3. Candidate Information: Displays and collates information about the candidates for an informed vote.
4. Results Display: View election results after the voting period.

_Program roadmap_
1. Welcome Page and Prompts.
2. User either renews voters' card or if renewed initiates the voting process.
3. Once completed, display successfully voted.
*Disclaimer:* There would be other features you can perform; primarily, we are focused on successful, safe, and secure voting processes.

To achieve the desired functionality for our program, we will implement the following features/functions described below;
A function that will Ask the users to Enter their ID to confirm their identity.
A function that will display the choices to vote from.
A function that will get users' input and confirm their voting choice.
A function that will send the user a confirmation message of their vote and also thank them for using the system.

USAGE:
1. Run the application:
	python home.py
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu and cast your vote.
