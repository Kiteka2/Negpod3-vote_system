 The Nzavote system is a Python program to allows citizens of a country to practice and improve their voting rights. The program will focus on eradicating electoral fraud. The program will be in different prompts starting from the user entering their identification number to then proceeding to voting. 

To achieve the desired functionality for our program, we will implement the following features/functions described below;
A function that will Ask the users to Enter their ID to confirm their identity.
A function that will display the choices to vote from.
A function that will get users' input and confirm their voting choice.
A function that will send the user a confirmation message of their vote and also thank them for using the system.
